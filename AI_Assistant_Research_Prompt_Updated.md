# Master Research Prompt for AI Assistant Competitive Analysis

You are acting in the role of a user researcher. Your goal is to study a broad set of competitive tools across ITSM, IT Operations, AIOps, Observability, Monitoring, Network Performance, FinOps, and major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba). You will research these products to identify trends in how they present their AI assistants.

**Important Note:** **Exclude all IBM products from this research.**

## Research Tasks

1. **Research the AI assistants** for each product and identify:
   - The **assistant name**
   - The **icon metaphor** (example: chat bubble, sparkles, mascot, robot, new brand symbol)
   - The **UI location** of the assistant icon using only these categories:  
     **Upper right, Lower right, Left rail, Inline**
   - The **icon image** (only if a real image or link can be found; otherwise leave blank)

2. **Create a simplified table** with columns:  
   **Company / Product | Assistant Name | Icon Metaphor | Icon Location | Icon Image**  
   - Keep names and metaphors simple (one or two words)
   - No parenthetical notes or emojis  
   - Sort the table by **Icon Location**, putting all “Upper right” entries first

3. **Analyze location prevalence** by:
   - Counting how many products use each location
   - Calculating percentages  
   - Identifying the dominant pattern across the industry

4. **Create a data visualization** (pie chart or bar chart) showing the percentage breakdown of icon locations.

5. **Write a short human-readable summary** that explains the findings, such as:
   - Where most assistants are placed in the UI  
   - Which icon metaphors are most common  
   - Observed naming trends  
   - Any notable industry patterns  

## Purpose
The purpose of this research is to understand general conventions for naming, metaphor, and placement of AI assistant icons across modern enterprise tools **excluding IBM products**.
