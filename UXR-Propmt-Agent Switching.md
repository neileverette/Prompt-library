# Multi-Agent UX Research Prompt (Reusable Markdown Version)

## 1. Context

This research prompt focuses on UX patterns for **multi-agent intelligent assistants**, specifically partial‑screen assistants used inside enterprise tools (side panels, drawers, flyouts). These assistants face unique design constraints such as limited space, no left-rail for agent pickers, and the need to balance contextual prompts with agent-mode prompts.

## 2. UX Challenges (Hypotheses)

- Users must clearly understand which agent or mode they are in.  
- Users must easily discover agent switching and how to use it.  
- Users must be able to return to the default mode at any time.  
- The assistant must maintain clear, unambiguous context.  
- The UX must scale as the number of agents grows.  

## 3. Tasks

Produce a research analysis including:

- Company  
- Assistant Name  
- Number of Agents  
- How agent switching works  
- How context visibility is maintained  
- How users return to default mode  
- Whether the pattern scales  

## 4. Screenshot Reference Table

Screenshots will be provided by the user each time this prompt is run.

| Figure | Token | Expected Content |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Figure 1 | screenshot_1 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 2 | screenshot_2 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 3 | screenshot_3 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 4 | screenshot_4 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 5 | screenshot_5 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 6 | screenshot_6 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 7 | screenshot_7 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 8 | screenshot_8 | User-provided screenshot |
| Figure 9 | screenshot_9 | User-provided screenshot |

## 5. Screenshot Usage Instructions

When analyzing, always reference both the **Figure number** and the **token**.

Example:

> “See Figure 2 (screenshot_2) for an example of a secondary agent-mode flow.”

## 6. Output Requirements

Your output must include:

1. A comparison table  
2. A pattern analysis  
3. A summary of industry conventions  
4. A Cartesian matrix  
5. UX pain points  
6. Guiding design principles for partial‑screen assistants
