Every slide must use one of these PROVEN VIRAL LAYOUTS:

Hero Layout: Dominant headline with single powerful visual

Contrast Layout: Split screen showing comparison or transformation

Icon Grid: Key points as icons with minimal supporting text

Quote Focus: Powerful statement with contextual visual

Process Flow: Clean steps or flowchart with intuitive visuals

Timeline / Storyline: Horizontal or vertical progression with visual milestones

Before / After: Dramatic transformation visualization

Photo Background: Full-bleed impactful image with overlaid text

Data Spotlight: Single statistic or data point magnified visually

Interactive Prompt: Question or challenge posed to audience with supporting visual

Anatomy Breakdown: Complex concept decomposed into labeled parts

Comparison Matrix: Grid comparing multiple options or features
