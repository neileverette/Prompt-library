  ↓
Evidence/Body (IBM Plex Sans Regular, 18–24pt, #525252)
```

**When to Use Powerful Quotes:**
- Include direct quotes from source material when they are particularly striking
- Quotes should reinforce key points, not replace original content
- Always attribute; cite source explicitly
- Format in Quote Focus layout with single accent color

---

## CONTENT GUIDANCE & BEST PRACTICES

### What Makes IBM Content Distinctive

**DO:**
- Use active voice and specific claims (not "improve" but "reduce by 35%")
- Lead with the insight or data point (headline-first approach)
- Reference source material explicitly when providing examples
- Use numbered steps when prescribing action (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- Include specific metrics, timelines, and measurable outcomes
- Break complex concepts into component parts (Anatomy Breakdown)
- Let visuals speak; minimize explanatory text
- Use questions to engage audience (Interactive Prompt layout)
- Build logical progression: Problem → Solution → Evidence → Action

**DON'T:**
- Use marketing superlatives ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "cutting-edge")
- Introduce concepts, tools, or examples not explicitly in source material
- Stack bullet points more than 4 per slide
- Use jargon without explanation
- Reference competitor products or solutions
- Make claims without supporting data
- Use vague language ("improve," "better," "enhanced" without metrics)
- Include decorative elements that don't reinforce message
- Mix multiple unrelated concepts on single slide
- Assume audience familiarity with domain-specific terms

### Source Material Handling

**Golden Rule:** Reference ONLY concepts explicitly present in source material.

**When quoting source material:**
- Use quotation marks
- Cite source explicitly (author, publication, date)
- Maximum 1–2 quotes per presentation (sparingly)
- Choose quotes that surprise or challenge, not confirm

**When paraphrasing:**
- Use own words and phrasing
- Attribute source in smaller text below slide
- Combine multiple sources only if explicitly comparing them

**When data/statistics appear:**
- Include source citation
- Provide context (compare to baseline, explain significance)
- Visualize numerically when possible
- Round large numbers for readability (e.g., "2.3M" not "2,347,829")

### Typography Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**Headline Typography:**
- **Font:** IBM Plex Mono Light (expressive, distinctive)
- **Size:** 44–60pt (scales based on slide content density)
- **Weight:** Light (300) for primary headlines
- **Color:** IBM Blue 60 (`#0f62fe`) OR `#161616` (near black)
- **Content:** Maximum 8 words
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned (default), centered only for hero/dramatic effect
- **Spacing:** 20–24pt line height

**Supporting Point Typography:**
- **Font:** IBM Plex Sans Bold
- **Size:** 28–32pt
- **Weight:** Bold (700)
- **Color:** `#161616` (near black) or `#525252` (neutral gray)
- **Content:** Maximum 15 words per point
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned for readability

**Body Text Typography:**
- **Font:** IBM Plex Sans Regular
- **Size:** 18–24pt (never smaller than 18pt for legibility)
- **Weight:** Regular (400)
- **Color:** `#525252` (neutral gray)
- **Content:** Maximum 20 words per text block
- **Line Height:** 1.5x (ample spacing for readability)
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned

**Label/Annotation Typography:**
- **Font:** IBM Plex Sans Regular
- **Size:** 14–16pt
- **Weight:** Regular (400)
- **Color:** `#525252` or accent color
- **Content:** Maximum 8 words per label

**Emphasis Technique (Use Sparingly):**
- **Bold:** Only for key terms or metrics in body text
- **Color:** Use IBM Blue 60 to highlight single most important point per slide
- **Size:** Larger size = more emphasis (use hierarchy, not size alone)
- **Never:** Italics, underlines, shadows, or decorative formatting

---

### Strategic Visual Element Decisions

**Choose IBM Pictograms When:**
- Representing concepts, processes, or categories
- Building icon grids (3–4 max)
- Illustrating workflow steps
- Emphasizing visual consistency with IBM brand
- Space is limited (compact, iconic representation)

**Choose Data Visualizations When:**
- Presenting statistics, metrics, or measurable outcomes
- Comparing multiple data points
- Showing trends or progression
- Need audience to grasp scale or magnitude
- Creating impact through numbers (Data Spotlight)

**Choose Color Blocks When:**
- Emphasizing a single critical statement or quote
- Highlighting a key metric or outcome
- Creating visual contrast (white space on colored background)
- Directing focus to headline or primary content
- Making a slide "sticky" visually (memorable)

**Choose Color Bars When:**
- Separating sections or creating visual rhythm
- Underlying a headline for emphasis (IBM Developer pattern)
- Creating visual connection between related elements
- Adding subtle visual sophistication without decoration
- Baseline alignment at typography cap height

**Choose Photography When:**
- Illustrating real-world context or implementation
- Creating emotional connection (enterprise audience context)
- Breaking up text-heavy sections
- Must use IBM-approved imagery (professional, uncluttered, intentional)
- Always overlay with text in color block for legibility

**Text Formatting Strategy:**
- Minimum 15% whitespace per slide (breathing room)
- Use grid alignment to create visual coherence
- Limit color usage: 1 accent per slide maximum
- Let typography hierarchy do the work (size/weight, not effects)
- Whitespace is a design tool, not wasted space

## IMPLEMENTATION TIPS FOR GOOGLE NOTEBOOKLM

### Workflow Steps

**Step 1: Load This Prompt First**
- Copy the ENTIRE prompt and paste into NotebookLM conversation
- Do NOT upload source materials yet
- Allow NotebookLM to acknowledge it understands the role and framework
- Example response to expect: Confirmation of IBM design principles and content structure

**Step 2: Upload Source Materials**
- Add all source documents (articles, reports, research, whitepapers)
- Wait for NotebookLM to confirm sources are loaded

**Step 3: Request Presentation Structure**
- Use this command: "Create a [X]-slide presentation deck using ONLY the provided source materials. Follow the 8-slide narrative structure (Compelling Start → Core Context → Central Concept → Key Components → Application Example → Practical Guidance → Impact & Results → Memorable Close). For each slide, specify: (1) Layout type, (2) IBM Blue 60 or accent color choice, (3) Typography hierarchy with exact word limits, (4) Visual element (pictogram/data viz/color block), (5) Headline (max 8 words), (6) Supporting content (max 15 words per point)."

**Step 4: Refine & Iterate**
- "Slide 3 should use an Anatomy Breakdown layout instead. Use IBM Blue 60 as primary accent."
- "The headline on Slide 5 exceeds 8 words. Reduce to exactly 7 words max."
- "Replace the decorative element with an IBM pictogram from the Developer brand library."
- "Add a color bar underneath the headline on Slide 7 for emphasis."

**Step 5: Verify Compliance**
- Check each slide against the Design Execution Checklist
- Call out any violations: "This slide uses gradients (prohibited). Use flat color block instead."
- Request attribution: "Add source citation for the statistic on Slide 6."

### Example Requests to NotebookLM

**For Layout Specification:**
"Use a Process Flow layout for Slide 6. Show 4 sequential steps with IBM pictograms, numbered 1–4, connected by arrows in IBM Blue 60. Limit each step label to max 4 words."
