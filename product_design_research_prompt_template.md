# Product Design Research Prompt Template

**You are acting as an industry research analyst investigating UX patterns for [TOPIC/FEATURE].  
Do deep, broad research across the industry with a focus on enterprise-grade [PRODUCT CATEGORY] that [KEY CAPABILITY].**

---

## 1. Context  

We are dealing with [new/emerging/evolving] UX pattern: **[DESCRIBE THE PATTERN OR PROBLEM]**  

There is currently **[no industry standard / limited standardization / fragmented approaches]** for how this should work, and we may be defining a new design approach [from scratch / building on existing patterns].

### Concrete Example  

[INSERT SPECIFIC REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE FROM YOUR DOMAIN]

For instance: [Company X] offers [Feature Y] as its [default/primary] [capability]. They announced [New Feature Z] which allows users to [action]. A user begins in [default state], but may need to [switch/transition/activate] to [specialized state] for [specific workflow]. After completing that task, the user must be able to [return/revert/exit] seamlessly and without confusion.

This [pattern/workflow/interaction] — [describe the flow] — does **not yet have clear UX conventions**, especially when scaled across [multiple products/enterprise suites/diverse use cases].

---

## 2. Initial Perceived UX Challenges  

Use these as hypotheses only. You may refine or expand them during research:

1. [Challenge related to clarity/understanding]
2. [Challenge related to discoverability]  
3. [Challenge related to navigation/workflow]  
4. [Challenge related to context/state management]  
5. [Challenge related to scalability]:  
   - [sub-challenge at product level]
   - [sub-challenge at suite level]  
   - [sub-challenge at portfolio level]

**Example challenges for multi-agent UX:**
- Users must clearly understand which tool or agent context they are in
- Users must easily discover that [feature] exists and understand how to use it
- Users must be able to [perform action] and return to their default context
- The [system] must maintain clear, unambiguous context at all times

---

## 3. Research Tasks  

Perform an **industry-wide search** for [PRODUCT CATEGORY] that support [KEY CAPABILITY].

### Inclusion Criteria  
- The [product/feature] must offer **[specific capability]**
- It must be **enterprise-focused** [or B2B/B2C as appropriate]
- Evaluate the **UI/UX patterns** of:  
  - [discovery mechanism]
  - [primary interaction model]  
  - [state/context visibility]  
  - [exit/return mechanism]
  - [any other key UX dimensions]

### Research Scope
- Minimum: [X] companies/products
- Focus on: [market leaders / innovators / specific vertical]
- Time period: [current products / launched in last X years]

---

## 4. Produce Competitive Analysis Table  

Create a table with these columns:

- **Company name**  
- **Product name**  
- **[Key metric 1]** (e.g., # of agents, # of modes, # of views)
- **[Key metric 2]** (e.g., pricing tier, target user)
- **How [key interaction] works (UI/UX summary)**
- **[Any other relevant dimension]**

Include 8-15 products minimum for comprehensive analysis.

---

## 5. Analyze for UX Patterns  

Determine:

- Whether any **industry-standard patterns** exist  
- Whether any **repeatable patterns** emerge across multiple vendors
- Whether the industry is **fragmented**, indicating lack of standardization  
- Which patterns appear to be **emerging leaders**
- Which patterns appear to be **anti-patterns** or failing approaches

For each identified pattern, document:
- **Pattern name**
- **Implementations** (which companies use it)
- **How it works** (interaction model)
- **Pros** (advantages, when it works well)
- **Cons** (limitations, when it fails)

---

## 6. Summary of Findings  

Write a comprehensive summary covering:

- **Industry landscape**: Overall state of [domain/feature]
- **Maturity assessment**: How developed is this UX space (rate 1-10)
- **Dominant philosophies**: Are there competing schools of thought?
- **Patterns inventory**: How companies handle [key interactions]
- **Emerging trends**: What's next? What's being experimented with?
- **Standards status**: Any emerging or proposed UX conventions?
- **Fragmentation level**: How much variation exists?
- **Market forces**: What's driving design decisions?

Assess whether this appears to be a **brand-new UX frontier** or whether we can rely on established patterns.

---

## 7. Visual Analysis (Optional but Recommended)

Create one or more of the following visualizations:

### Option A: Cartesian Matrix  
Create a 2-axis matrix that plots each company/product:
- **X-Axis:** [Key dimension 1] (e.g., # of features, complexity, price)
- **Y-Axis:** [Key dimension 2] (e.g., visibility, automation level, control)

### Option B: Timeline
Show evolution of the pattern over time

### Option C: Taxonomy/Hierarchy
Map how different approaches relate to each other

### Option D: User Journey Map
Show how different vendors handle the same user workflow

---

## 8. Identify UX Problems & Pain Points  

Based on your findings, summarize the **key UX challenges** teams will face, especially considering:

- [Domain-specific workflow 1]
- [Domain-specific workflow 2]  
- [Interaction challenge 1] (e.g., switching between general-purpose and specialized modes)
- [Interaction challenge 2] (e.g., jumping across products or contexts)
- [Cognitive challenge] (e.g., maintaining continuity, clarity, and user mental models)
- [Scale challenge] (e.g., managing complexity as [features/products/options] grow)

For each problem:
- **Problem name**
- **Description**: What is the issue?
- **Manifestations**: How does it show up in products?
- **Impact**: Why does it matter?
- **Examples**: Real-world instances from your research

Aim for 6-10 key problems minimum.

---

## 9. Provide Guiding Design Principles  

Write a concise set of design principles focusing on:

- **Clarity** (of context, state, capabilities)
- **Discoverability** (finding features, understanding options)
- **Navigation** (movement between states, reversibility)
- **Scalability** (handling growth in complexity)
- **Cognitive load** (reducing mental effort)
- **[Domain-specific principle]** (e.g., speed, accuracy, trust)

For each principle:
- **Principle name** (brief, memorable)
- **Description** (1-2 sentences explaining the principle)
- **Application** (3-5 concrete bullet points showing how to apply it)

Keep these principles:
- **Short** (one sentence description)
- **Focused** (one clear idea per principle)  
- **Practical** (can be applied to design decisions)
- **Measurable** (can assess if you're following it)

Aim for 8-12 principles.

---

## 10. [Your Company] Specific Recommendations

Given [Your Company]'s context:
- Products: [List relevant products]
- Users: [Target user personas]
- Constraints: [Technical, business, or organizational constraints]
- Goals: [What you're trying to achieve]

Provide **actionable recommendations** organized by timeframe:

### Immediate (1-2 sprints)
[3-5 actions that can be started right away]

### Short-term (3-6 months)
[3-5 initiatives for next quarter]

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
[3-5 strategic efforts for next year]

### Long-term (12-24 months)
[3-5 transformational initiatives]

Each recommendation should include:
- **Action item** (what to do)
- **Rationale** (why it matters, which problem it solves)
- **Expected outcome** (what success looks like)

Total of 12-15 recommendations across all timeframes.

**Original Research Project**: Multi-Agent UX Patterns

**Customizations Made**:
- Topic: Multi-agent AI assistants  
- Product category: Enterprise AI platforms
- Key capability: Agent switching and orchestration
- Added section: Agent marketplaces & user-created agents
- Domain-specific principles: Clear context & task flow, Easy discoverability first
- Company context: IBM (Instana, Turbonomic, Concert, SevOne, NS1)

## Tips for Effective Research

1. **Start broad, then focus**: Begin with wide industry scan, narrow to relevant patterns
2. **Look for divergence**: Pay attention to where vendors disagree - signals uncertainty
3. **Watch the leaders**: Market leaders often set patterns others follow
4. **Note the experiments**: Beta features show where the industry is heading
5. **Consider context**: B2B and B2C may have very different patterns for same feature
6. **Document anti-patterns**: Knowing what doesn't work is as valuable as knowing what does
7. **Seek primary sources**: Go to product docs, not just articles about products
8. **Test when possible**: Hands-on experience beats reading descriptions
9. **Look for convergence**: When multiple vendors independently arrive at same solution, pay attention
10. **Think systems**: Consider how patterns scale, compose, and interact
